# Homework-4-Quiz
The original plan for this quiz application was to include features such as a timer that counts down toward zero upon starting, penalties for incorrect answers, and a high score list saved to local storage. After discovering that my coding skills are still insifficient to implement this functionality, and being unable to locate a satisfactory solution through online research, the pressure to submit something tangible led me to put together a modified version of a preexisting program that incorporates information more relevant to this assignment. I'm eager for an opportunity to examine an example whose behavior aligns closer with what's demonstrated in the provided model. Also omitted from this is the use of questions held within arrays, instead replaced by a basic series of strings. 
A running theme so far during the boot camp is a humbling recognition that to establish even seemingly minor details often requires a surprisingly amount of explicit and tedious logic spanning multiple lines. However, the cumbersome nature in terms of code length is negligible in difficulty compared to simply possessing the ability of knowing how to construct a cohesive arrangment that yields the desired outcomes. As I've stated before, hopefully with each newfound technical grasp a developer's overall toolkit becomes augmented so that one day the separate yet interrelated pieces may be converged to allow greater efficiency and robustness in all facets of design.
